# README

* Download [ImageMagick](http://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#macosx)
    * I recommend downloading [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/install.php) first and then running `sudo port install ImageMagick`
    * Using Homebrew doesn't update the necessary dependencies as easily and was a huge headache

* Paperclip cares about the security of your app like no one else does! Starting from version 4, it is required to have at least a content type validation in your model
    * But, what if weâ€™re seasoned developers and can take care of ourselves? Can we tell Paperclip that our attachments should not be validated? But, of course:
    * `do_not_validate_attachment_file_type :avatar`
