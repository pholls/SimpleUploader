# README

* Download [ImageMagick](http://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#macosx)
    * I recommend downloading [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/install.php) first and then running `sudo port install ImageMagick`
    * Using Homebrew doesn't update the necessary dependencies as easily and was a huge headache
